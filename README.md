# billy-mcp — Billy (billy.dk) MCP Server for Claude & AI Assistants

**Connect Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible AI assistant to [Billy](https://www.billy.dk/) — the Danish accounting platform (billysbilling).** Create invoices, book journal entries, check account balances, reconcile bank lines, and attach receipts — with built-in human-approval write protection so your AI never books anything without your sign-off.

## What can it do?

Ask your AI assistant things like:

- *"Create an invoice for Acme ApS: 10 consulting hours at 1.200 DKK, due in 14 days"*
- *"What's the balance of account 5211 this quarter?"* (trial balance from live postings)
- *"Book last month's payroll as a journal entry — draft it, I'll approve"*
- *"Void these 34 duplicate entries"* (one call, one approval, per-item results)
- *"Upload this receipt PDF and attach it to journal entry #67"*
- *"Which invoices are overdue and unpaid?"*

**40 tools** covering invoices, supplier bills, contacts, products, bank payments, manual journal entries (daybook transactions), postings, trial balance, bank reconciliation, file attachments, a sandboxed batch-scripting tool, and a raw API escape hatch for everything else.

## Quick start

### 1. Get a Billy access token

Log into [mit.billy.dk](https://mit.billy.dk/) → **Settings → Access tokens → Create access token**. Tokens are per-company and don't expire.

### 2. Add to your MCP client

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`) / **Cursor** / any JSON-config host:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "billy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "billy-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BILLY_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** (CLI):

```sh
claude mcp add billy -e BILLY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your token> -- npx -y billy-mcp
```

**VS Code** (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "billy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "billy-mcp"],
      "env": { "BILLY_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:billy-token}" }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it — no clone, no build. `npx` fetches the published package.

### From source (development)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thourum/billy-mcp.git
cd billy-mcp
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # paste your token
npm run dev               # run over stdio
npm run inspector         # try tools in the MCP Inspector UI
```

## Write protection — safe for real financial data

Every write (create/update/approve/void/pay/upload) is gated by `BILLY_WRITE_MODE`:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `read-only` | Write tools are not registered at all; raw requests reject non-GET |
| `confirm` **(default)** | Each write pauses and shows **you** a native approval dialog (MCP elicitation) with the full payload — the AI cannot approve its own writes |
| `full` | Writes execute without approval |

Fail-closed: if your MCP host doesn't support elicitation dialogs, `confirm` mode **blocks writes** with instructions instead of executing them. Irreversible operations (approve invoice, void entry, bank payments) are additionally flagged `destructiveHint` so hosts can add their own guardrails. Declining, dismissing, or leaving the checkbox unticked = nothing is booked.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BILLY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | yes | Billy API access token (sent as `X-Access-Token`) |
| `BILLY_WRITE_MODE` | no | `read-only`, `confirm` (default), or `full` |
| `BILLY_ORGANIZATION_ID` | no | Auto-resolved when the token maps to one company |
| `BILLY_BASE_URL` | no | Defaults to `https://api.billysbilling.com/v2` |
| `BILLY_LOCALE` | no | `en_US`, `da_DK`, `fr_FR`, `nl_NL`, `de_DE` |

## Tools

<details>

**Organization & contacts** — `get_organization`, `list_contacts`, `get_contact`, `create_contact`, `update_contact`, `list_contact_persons`, `create_contact_person`

**Products** — `list_products`, `get_product`, `create_product`, `update_product`

**Invoices** — `list_invoices`, `get_invoice`, `create_invoice` (embedded lines, draft or approve-immediately), `approve_invoice`, `delete_invoice`

**Bills (expenses)** — `list_bills`, `get_bill`, `create_bill`

**Payments** — `create_bank_payment` (mark invoices/bills paid), `list_bank_payments`, `list_balance_modifiers`

**Journal entries (daybook)** — `create_daybook_transaction` (client-side debit/credit balance validation + idempotency-key safe retry), `void_daybook_transaction`, `batch_void_daybook_transactions` (N voids, one approval), `list_daybook_transactions`, `list_daybooks`

**Reporting & reconciliation** — `get_account_balances` (trial balance / per-account balance from postings), `list_postings`, `list_transactions`, `list_accounts`, `get_account`, `list_bank_lines`, `list_bank_line_matches`

**Files & attachments** — `upload_file` (pdf/jpg/png/gif), `attach_file` (link to invoice/bill/journal entry), `list_files`, `list_attachments`

**Power tools** — `execute_script` (sandboxed JS batch runner with server-enforced mutation log + `dry_run`), `billy_raw_request` (any Billy v2 endpoint)

</details>

### Built for LLM agents, not just humans

- **Compact responses by default** (~90% fewer tokens); pass `verbose: true` for full payloads
- **`appliedFilters` transparency**: Billy silently ignores unknown query params — every list tool reports which filters ran server-side vs client-side, so the agent never mistakes "filter ignored" for "no results"
- **Pre-flight validation**: imbalanced journal entries are rejected client-side with per-currency debit/credit totals before an approval is ever requested
- **Idempotent retries**: `idempotencyKey` on journal entries dedupes safely after timeouts
- **Batch with one approval**: `execute_script` runs loops (e.g. 34 voids) with a full audit log returned even when the script fails mid-run

## FAQ

**Is this an official Billy integration?** No — community project using Billy's public REST API v2.

**Does it work with Billy's free plan?** Yes, any account that can create access tokens at mit.billy.dk.

**Can the AI spend my money?** In default `confirm` mode, no write happens without you clicking approve in a dialog the model can't touch. Use `read-only` for pure analysis sessions.

**Which AI apps are supported?** Anything speaking Model Context Protocol over stdio: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code (GitHub Copilot), Zed, and more.

## Development

```sh
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
